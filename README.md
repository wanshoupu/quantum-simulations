*A generic quantum compiler for quantum computing*

Given a Hamiltonian — including its most general Lindblad form, i.e., Lindbladian — this tool compiles it into an executable quantum circuit. It currently supports **Cirq**, **Qiskit**, **SymPy**,
and is designed to be extensible to other frameworks.

The project is still under active development, but you can check out the working demos here:
