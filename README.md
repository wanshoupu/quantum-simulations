# quantum-simulations

A generic quantum computing compiler is implemented.

Given a Hamiltonian (even in its most general Lindblad form), my tool compiles it into a suitable quantum circuit with support of cirq, kiskit, sympy, and extensible to any other framework. There
are still a lot of work to do. But you are welcome to check out the demos here: https://github.com/wanshoupu/quantum-simulations/blob/main/demo
