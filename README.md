# quantum-simulations

A generic quantum compiler for quantum computing is implemented in this project.

Given a Hamiltonian — including its most general Lindblad form — this tool compiles it into an executable quantum circuit. It currently supports **Cirq**, **Qiskit**, **SymPy**, and is designed to be extensible to other frameworks.

The project is still under active development, but you can check out the working demos here:
