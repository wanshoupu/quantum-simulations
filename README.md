*A generic quantum compiler for quantum computing*

Given a Hamiltonian — even its most general Lindblad form, i.e., Lindbladian — this tool compiles it into an executable quantum circuit. It currently supports **Cirq**, **Qiskit**,
and is designed to be extensible to other frameworks. For example,

📄 [![Circuit sketch compiled off an 8x8 cyclic unitary matrix](docs/qc_qiskit_sketch.png)](docs/qc_qiskit_sketch.pdf)

This sketch was generated by first compiling the a `8x8` cyclic permutation matrix, and then render the compiled code on [Qiskit](https://github.com/qiskit).
