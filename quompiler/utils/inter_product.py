    This method is a shorthand for reverse sequentially applying `inter_product`:
    inter_product(inter_product(inter_product(A, B, m), C, n), ...) where yeast = [..., C, B]

    It carries out the `inter_product` operation reverse sequentially:
    - `dough = A` (the initial matrix),
    - `yeast = [..., C, B]` to be ⨂ onto dough in reverse sequential order,
    - `factor = [..., n, m]` are the corresponding `rising factors`.

    **Concept:**
    Yeast is applied to the dough in the order—i.e., the first yeast in the list affects the finest subdivision of the matrix dough.
    Visually:
        -yeast0-yeast1-...-yeast2-yeast3-
    This requires that the factors shall be non-increasing order.
    If we divide A into equal blocks by factors, the block sizes will be the factors, f0, f1, ...
    We use notation A(f0), A(f1), ... to repr the factor matrices after this division.
    For more detail, see
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product#Tracy%E2%80%93Singh_product

    **Parameters:**
    :param matrices: A list of square matrices with shapes (k1, k1), (k2, k2), ..., where each ki > 0.
    :param factors: A list of integers [f0, f1, ...], where:
        - f2 divides 1, f3 divides f2, ..., m divides fn
        - len(factors) == len(yeast),

    Each factor determines how the matrix (bread) is recursively partitioned into smaller blocks. The corresponding yeast matrices are then applied using a Kronecker-style (mesh) multiplication to enrich the structure.

    **Returns:**
    The result of the recursive inter-product operation:
        A(f0) ⨂ Y1 ⨂ A(f1) ⨂ ... ⨂ Yn ⨂ A(fn)
